#' @description This dataset is a subset of the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior 
#'        Surveillance System (YRBSS) data, consisting of 45 variables related 
#'        to demographics such as sex, race, age, grade, and sexual orientation,
#'         as well as substance use and reckless behaviors in adolescents. 
#'         However, it is important to note that this subset is intended for 
#'         teaching purposes only and should not be used to draw definitive 
#'         conclusions. This is because all variables related to weights, 
#'         strata, and PSU used in the original survey have been removed 
#'         from this subset.
